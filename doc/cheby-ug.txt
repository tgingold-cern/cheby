== What is Cheby ?

*Cheby* is both a text description of the interface between hardware
and software, and a tool to automatically generate code or
documentation from the text files.

In Cheby, the hardware appears to the software as a block of address in the
physical memory space.  There might be other way to interface hardware and
software (for example through a standard serial bus like USB or through a
network).

The block of address is named the memory map of the hardware.  The memory map
is a map between addresses and hardware elements like registers or memories.

The hardware elements supported by Cheby are:

* Registers.  A register uses one word of memory (usually 32 bits) or
two (so 64 bits), and is divided into fields (a group of bit).  Some
bits of the registers can be unused.  The difference between a
register and a memory is that hardware has direct access to a
register, there are wires between the register and the hardware so as
soon as the software writes to a register the hardware 'can' see the
new value. A register is usually read-write: the value of the register
is defined by the last write (from the software) and the software
always reads the last value.  A register can also be read-only: the
hardware defines the value that is read.  It is also possible that a
read triggers some changes in the hardware.  Finally a register can be
write-only, and usually a write triggers an action.  In that case, a
value read has no meaning.

* Memories. A memory is like a RAM memory except that hardware also
has access to it (through a second port, hence the name dual
port).  Memories are used when a certain amount of data has to be
transfered or to configure hardware for data transfers (like DMA
descriptors).  To avoid possible conflicts, memories are usually one
direction: the software can read and the hardware can write, or the
software can write and the hardwire can read.

* Submap.  A submap is a sub-block of the memory map (an aligned
continuous range of address) either defined by an external file or
will be available to the hardware designer.  Submaps make possible to
create a hierarchy of blocks and to create custom blocks.

A fundamental feature of the Cheby text description is non-ambiguity: the
memory map is defined by the file and there is only one way to assign addresses
to hardware elements.

Once the text file is written it is possible to invoke the cheby tool to
generate:

* C headers
* Device drivers
* HDL code
* HTML documentation

The automatic generation of these files avoid a tedious work and ensure
coherency between them.


== User Starting Guide

Let's work on a very simple design: a counter.  The hardware
increments a countewr every cycle until it reaches a maximal value,
then it starts again from 0.

As a designer, you have to implement the counter but you can use Cheby
to generate the interface.  The counter needs:

* A one bit register to enable/disable it.

* A 32-bit register containing the maximal value

* A 32-bit register with the current value.

In this user starting guide only the `cheby` command line tool is used, and
the input file is created by any text editor.

Let's assume the design uses the wishbone bus, and create a Cheby file that
describes the above elements.

[source]
----
include::srcs/counter.cheby[]
----

The description of the file format is documented later in this guide.

For the hardware designer, cheby can generate the hardware interface:
for VHDL this is an entity and its associated architecture and for
verilog this is a module.  The hardware interface contains the wishbone bus,
the registers described in the file, the decoding logic, and ports for the
registers.

To generate VHDL:
[source]
----
  cheby --gen-hdl=counter.vhdl -i counter.cheby
----

Here is the entity part generated by the tool:
[source]
----
include::srcs/counter_entity.vhdl[]
----

You can see the wishbone ports and the ports for the counter.

As an hardware designer, you have to write the HDL code for the counter logic.
The enable and maximum value are given by the interface, and you should give
the current value.

Because the interface is defined (and hopefully well documented), it is also
possible for the software developer to start the software part.  The SW
developer needs to program the register and therefore to know the register
map.  So let's generate the corresponding C header:
[source]
----
include::srcs/counter.h[]
----

The absolute address of the counter is determined by the instantiation
of this module, but you can refer directly to the registers.

In order for the end-user or a developper to have a better view of the design,
it is better to read a documentation.  A doc can be generated from the
description file:

[source]
----
  cheby --gen-doc=counter.html -i counter.cheby
----

For our example, the generated doc is:

include::srcs/counter-reindent.md[]

== Cheby File Format

=== General Structure

The Cheby file format represent a hierachy of nodes.  A node contains
a list of attribute and children.  An attribute is designated by a name and
has a value (a string, a boolean or an integer).  The children are nodes,
organized as a list.

The Cheby file format described in this manual is based on YAML, so
that there is no new format to invent and many text editors have
already support for it.  However the file extension is usually
`.cheby`.

The nodes are `memory-map`, `reg`, `field`, `memory`, `repeat`, `block`
and `submap`.

Some attributes are common to all nodes:

* `name`: The name of the node.  This is required for all nodes.  The name is
also used to create HDL or C names in general files.

* `comment`: This should be a short text that explain the purpose
of the node.  The description is copied into the code (as a comment)
to make it more readable.  This attribute is not required but it is recommended
to always provide it.

* `description`: This is a longer text that will be copied into the generated
documentation.

* `children`: For nodes that have children, this is a list of the children.

* `address`: An optional byte address relative to the parent.  The address must
be correctly aligned.  If not provided or it the value is `next`, then the
address is computed using the previous one and the alignment.  It is possible
to go backward by providing explicit address (eg: the first child has address 4
and the second one has address 0), but this is not recommended and be a source
of errors (in particular with automatic addresses that are always computed
from the previous node). Overlapping addresses are detected by the tools.

* `x-NAME`: Extensions for tool or feature `NAME`. The Cheby file
format is extensible so that new tools can be easily created without
backward compatibility issues.

* `x-hdl`: Extensions for hdl generation.

* `x-gena`: Extensions for Gena compatibility.

* `x-wbgen`: Extensions for wbgen compatibility.

=== Header

A cheby file is an associative array named `memory-map`.  The only purpose of
this name is to easily refuse a random YAML file.

The `bus` attribute specifies which bus will be used to interface the CPU with
the HW module.  It can be:

* wb-32-be: non-pipelined wishbone with 32 bit of data using the big-endian
convention

* axi4-lite-32: AIX4 lite bus with 32 bit of data

* cern-be-vme-SZ: CERN VME-like bus using `SZ` data bit.  `SZ` can be
8, 16 or 32.

The attribute `word-endian` can be used to specify the word endianness
(how multi-word registers are laid out in memory).  It is optionnal,
and the default is set according to the bus: `big` by default for
`wb-32-be` and `cern-be-vme`, `little` for `axi4-lite-32`.  It is also
possible to use `none` to disallow any multi-word registers, and thus having
a portable memory map.

If you need to reserve area in a module, you can use the `size` attribute to
specify the size (in bytes) of the memory space used by the module.  The suffixes
k, M and G are allowed.

It is possible to specify a semantic version using the `version` attribute.
The version consists of 3 numbers between 0 and 255 separated by comma.
The version appears in generated files.

The following attributes under `x-hdl` are supported:

`busgroup`:: Use an input and an output record (in vhdl) for the bus.  The
value is a boolean.

`iogroup`:: Use an input and and output record (in vhdl) for the I/O. This
will also generate a package to declare the records.  The value of this
attribute is the name of the port.

`reg_prefix`:: If false, discard register prefix and every prefix before
register.  This creates shorter names.

`block_prefix`:: If false, discard block prefix.

`pipeline`:: Finely define the pipelining.  In case of timing closure issues,
you can set this value to "all".  Possible values are "rd-in", "rd-out",
"wr-in", "wr-out".  Values starting with "wr-" act on signals for write
commands, while values starting with "rd-" act on signals for read commands.
Values finishing with "-in" acts on input signals, while values finishing
with "-out" acts on output signals.  So for example "wr-in" adds a
registers on input signals for write commands.  It is possible to use a
set of values separated by commas.  The default is "wr-in,rd-out".
There are also aliases: "wr" is for "wr-in,wr-out", "rd" for "rd-in,rd-out",
"in" for "wr-in,rd-in" and "out" for "wr-out,rd-out".
Finally it is possible to use "none" not to use any pipelining.
The pipelining is a single barrier of registers inserted on an internal bus,
which is created from the external bus.

=== Registers

A register uses one (usual case) or two (for 64-bit registers) words address.
It can be directly read or written by the CPU and each used bit or group of
bits generates a port.

The access mode is defined from the point of view of the software.  It slightly
change the generated hardware:

* rw (read/write): This generates flip-flops whose value is directly
available to the hardware.  The software can write to modify the value or
read the get the current value.  The hardware cannot change the value.

* wo (write-only): Like `rw`, but the software cannot read the current value.

* ro (read-only): This creates no hardware but just a port.  The software can
read the current value of the port, and cannot modify it.

The size (in bits) of the register can be specified by the `width` attribute.
The size cannot be larger than two words.

It is possible to have fields in a register.  A field is a group of
consecutive bits and has a name.

If there is no field, this is a plain register.

The following attributes under `x-hdl` are supported:

`write-strobe`:: True to generate an additional signal that is
asserted when the register is written by the host.  The name of the
signal is '_wr_o' appended to the name of the register.

`read-strobe`:: True to generate an additional signal that is asserted
when the register is read by the host.  The name of the signal is
'_rd_o' appended to the name of the register.

`write-ack`:: True to generate an additional signal for the write ack.  The
user must assert this signal for one cycle to acknowledge the write.  It
doesn't make sense to have this signal without the write strobe signal.  The
name of the signal is '_wack_i' appended to the name of the register.

`read-ack`:: True to generate an additional signal for the read ack.  The user
must assert this signal for one cycle to acknowledge the read.  It doesn't
make sense to have this signal without the read strobe signal.  The name of
the signal is '_rack_i' appended to the name of the register.

`port`:: Defines how ports are created and only when there are fields.
When set to `reg`, only one port per direction is created using the
size of the register.  User has to extract the fields from this port.  When
set to `field` (the default), ports are created for each field.

==== Plain Registers

A plain register has a type, which could be `unsigned` (the default), `signed`
or `float`.  The type has no impact on the hardware, but changes the
software view.

It is possible to define the initial (just after a reset) value of a
register using the `preset` attribute.  For 32 bit registers, you can
also use the map version (set in the root) as the initial value by
giving the value `version` to the `preset` attribute.  Bits 0 to 7 are
set to the patch level, bits 8 to 15 to the minor version and bits 16
to 23 to the major.  You cannot have both `preset` and `constant` attributes.

Using the `constant` attribute, you can also give the value of attributes
from the root `x-cern-info` mapping.  When the `constant` attribute of
a register is set to `map-version`, the value of the register is set
to the value of the map-version.  Likewise for `ident-code`.

The `type` attribute within `x-hdl` is available and behaves as
defined below in the section for fields.

Example of a plain register:

[source]
----
    - reg:
        name: reg1
        description: a reg without fields
        width: 32
        access: rw
        type: unsigned
        preset: 0x123
----

==== Fields

There can be several fields in a register, and all of them have the same
access right.  Bits used by a field are specified by the `range` attribute.
The range is a single number if the field is 1 bit, or in the form of `lo-hi`
where `lo` is the lowest bit and `hi` is the highest bit.  Bits are numbered
using the little endian convention.

It is possible to define the initial value of a field using the
`preset` attribute.

The `type` attribute within `x-hdl` is available.  It can be set to
`reg` (the default unless register access type is `ro`), or `wire`
(the default when the access type is `ro`) or `const`. When set to
`wire` no register is created.

Example of a register with two fields:

[source]
----
    - reg:
        name: reg0
        description: a normal reg with some fields
        width: 32
        access: rw
        children:
          - field:
              name: field0
              description: 1-bit field
              range: 1
          - field:
              name: field1
              description: a field with a preset value
              range: 10-8
              preset: 2
----

=== Blocks

A block is simply a group of elements (registers, rams, submaps or blocks).
This is used only to create a hierarchy, but also offers the possibility
to specify an address or an alignment.

It is possible to reserve space at the end of a block with the `size`
attribute.  It specifies the size (in bytes) of the block. The suffixes k, M
and G are allowed.

Example of a block:

[source]
----
    - block:
        name: block1
        description: A block of registers
        children:
        - reg:
           name: b1reg0
           access: wo
           width: 32
----

=== RAMs

A RAM is represented by an `memory` element with one register as a
child.  The size of the ram is specified by the `memsize` attribute
(usually it should be a power of 2) and allows k, M or G suffixes.
Note that the width of the ram (the number of address lines) is computed from
the size of the ram and the size of the register.

Unless the attribute 'interface' is present, the memory is automatically
instantiated.  Otherwise the attribute specifies the type of bus, like
for an external submap.

Example of a ram:

[source]
----
    - memory:
        name: ram_ro1
        memsize: 16
        children:
          - reg:
              name: value
              access: rw
              width: 32
----

=== Repetition

It is possible to replicate elements using `repeat`.  The number of
repetitions is set by the `count` attribute.

Be careful that such a repetition can generate a lot of hardware.

Example of a replication:

[source]
----
    - repeat:
        name: arr1
        count: 2
        align: False
        children:
          - reg:
              name: areg1
              access: rw
              width: 32
----

=== Submap

If the `filename` attribute is not present, then this is a generic
submap and a bus port is generated in the HDL.  The size of the submap
is required.  The attribute `interface` specifies which interface is used
for the connection.

Example of a generic submap:

[source]
----
    - submap:
        name: sub3
        size: 0x1000
        description: A bus
        interface: wb-32-be
----

If the `filename` attribute is present, the `size` attribute is not allowed as
the size of the submap is defined by the memory map given by the file.  If the
`include` attribute is present and set to `True`, then the memory map
described by the file is included directly, otherwise a bus interface is
generated in the HDL.

Example of a normal submap:

[source]
----
    - submap:
        name: sub1
        description: A normal submap
        filename: demo_all_sub.cheby
----

Example of an included submap:

[source]
----
    - submap:
        name: sub2
        description: An included submap
        filename: demo_all_sub.cheby
        include: True
----

==  Generated HDL

For all buses, only word accesses are supported.  Sub-word (byte or half-word)
accesses are considered as word accesses (which can lead to error when
writting).

Addresses are always byte addresses.

For registers longer than a word on a big-endian bus, the most significant
word is at the lowest address. There is one bit per word for strobe bits, and
they follow word order (bit 0 strobes the lowest word).

===  Semantics

The value of any unused field (within a defined register) is always read as 0.
This is to allow future compatibility.  However undefined addresses may
return any value.  In case of read or write to an undefined address, the
transaction is acknowledge (or passed to a submodule or a submap).  Code
generated by Cheby never blocks a request.

===  AXI4-Lite

There are several restrictions from the AMBA AXI standard:

* There can be no combinatorial paths between input and
output signals (A3.2.1).  So there must be at least one
register.

* A source is not permitted to wait until READY is asserted before
asserting VALID.  Likewise, a destination is permitted to wait for
VALID to be assert before asserting the corresponding READY (A3.2.1).

There are registers for each channel.  The W and AW channels waits until
both have a request, handle the request and then become ready when the B
channel becomes ready.

Note that AXI4 addresses are byte addresses as specified in A3.4.1

=== Wishbone

The normal wishbone protocol is used (and not the pipelined one).

The `err` (error) and `rty` (retry) are always ignored (as inputs) and
never asserted as output.

By default the wishbone interface uses one port per wishbone signal.  It is
possible to group all signals in one input and one output port by setting the
`x-hdl.busgroup` attribute to `True`.


== Gena Compatibility

For Cheburashka/Gena users, there is a simple transition path.  You can
convert a regular Cheburashka XML file to the cheby format using `gena2cheby`:

[source]
----
  $ gena2cheby FILE.xml
----

This tool writes on the standard output a cheby file.  Note that this file
contains several extensions (under `x-gena` arrays) so that all the feature
of the XML file are kept.

It is possible to generate a VHDL file (that is very similar to the VHDL
file generated by Gena) using cheby:

[source]
----
  $ cheby --gen-gena-regctrl=OUTPUT.vhdl -i INPUT.cheby
  $ cheby --gen-gena-memmap=OUTPUT.vhdl -i INPUT.cheby
----

Use the `--gena-commonvisual` option of `--gen-gena-regctrl` to use components
from the CommonVisual library instead of generating directly the code for them.

== wbgen Compatibility

There is also a transition path for wbgen users.  If you have a fully
declarative and well formed wbgen file, you can convert it to the cheby
file:

[source]
----
  $ wbgen2cheby FILE.wb
----

This generate a cheby file on the standard output.  Note that this file
contains extensions using `x-wbgen` arrays.

It is possible to generate a VHDL file that is very similar to the VHDL
file generated by wbgen using cheby:

[source]
----
  $ cheby --gen-wbgen-hdl=OUTPUT.vhdl -i INPUT.cheby
----

== Cheby Command-Line Tool

The `cheby` tool can generate various files from an input file.  The input
file must be specified with the `-i` flag:

[source]
----
  $ cheby ACTION1 ACTION2... -i INPUT.cheby
----

An action flag is a flag optionally followed by a file name.  If the file name
is not present, the result is sent to the standard output.

[source]
----
  $ cheby --gen-hdl=output.vhdl -i input.cheby
  $ cheby --gen-hdl -i input.cheby
----

=== Generating HDL

Either VHDL or verilog can be generated by `cheby`.  You can specify the
language (either `vhdl` or `verilog`) with the `--hdl` flag, the default
being `vhdl`.

[source]
----
  $ cheby --hdl=vhdl --gen-hdl=OUTPUT.vhdl -i INPUT.cheby
----

=== Generating EDGE file

You can generate an EDGE block definition (in CSV) with the
`--gen-edge` flag.  Note that you need to provide the other part of
the files.

[source]
----
  $ cheby --gen-edge -i INPUT.cheby
----

=== Generating C header

The definition of a C structure representing the layout of the design is
generated using the `--gen-c` flag.

[source]
----
  $ cheby --gen-c -i INPUT.cheby
----

Through the submap feature of Cheby, a design can reference another
design stored in a different file. In the header file generated, the
structure for the referenced design is not redefined, but imported
through an `include` directive, using the `DESIGN.h` name (without any
directory).  So it is expected that either all the headers are stored
in the same directory or that the include pathes are specified to the
C compiler (using `-I` for example).

The generated header files use the standard integer types defined in
`<stdint.h>`, but without including `<stdint.h>`.  This is done on purpose so
that the file can still be used on systems that don't hane `stdint.h`.  So
you need to include `stdint.h` before including the generated header files,
or to include an equivalent header file.

With the option `--c-style=arm`, the header generated follows more closely
the CMSIS style.

It is also possible to generate a C program that check the layout is the same
as the layout seen by Cheby.  This can be used as a consistency check.

[source]
----
  $ cheby --gen-c-check-layout -i INPUT.cheby
----

=== Generating documentation

Documentation can be generated either in HTML or in markdown (tested with
asciidoctor).  The format is specified by the `--doc=FORMAT` flag and the
format is either `html` or `md`.

[source]
----
  $ cheby --doc=md --gen-doc=OUTPUT.md -i INPUT.cheby
----

=== Generating constants file

In order to write testbench, you can generate an include files that
defines the address of the registers, the offset and a mask for each fields.

[source]
----
  $ cheby --consts-style=STYLE --gen-consts -i INPUT.cheby
----

The `STYLE` can be either `verilog` or `vhdl`. For vhdl the addresses and the
offsets are integers, and the mask is not generated (as it would often overflow
the integer range).

=== Generating SILECS file

It is possible to generate SILECS
(https://wikis.cern.ch/display/SIL/Design+document) XML file from a
Cheby description.  Not all features of Cheby are supported: only registers.

[source]
----
  $ cheby --gen-silecs -i INPUT.cheby
----

=== Custom pass

If you need a very specific feature, you can implement your own pass, and invoke it
using `--gen-custom`:

[source]
----
  $ cheby --gen-custom[=OUTPUT] -i INPUT.cheby
----

The Cheby tool will read the `gen_custom.py` file in the current directory and call
the `generate_custom` function.

=== Generating text files

It is possible to general a compact text file describing the layout of
a cheby file with the `--print-memmap` flag.  This could be useful to have
a quick look on alignment effects.

[source]
----
  $ cheby --print-memmap -i INPUT.cheby
----

To display the fields, use `--print-simple`:

[source]
----
  $ cheby --print-simple -i INPUT.cheby
----

When a part of the design is replicated (using the `repeat` attribute) you
can view the effect of it with the `--print-simple-expanded` flag.

[source]
----
  $ cheby --print-simple-expanded -i INPUT.cheby
----

Finally to regenerated the initial file (properly indented but without the
comments), you can use `--print-pretty` or `--print-pretty-expanded`.
