Cheby file format
=================

This is a semi-formal description of the Cheby file format.  It is not
formal because most of the semantic is described in English.

The purpose of the Cheby format is to describe the memory map of a device,
down to the bit.  From this file, it is possible to derive source files like
a C header file representing this memory map, a VHDL file decoding the
memory map, etc.  Some tools may require additional information that aren't
described in this core document; but the file format supports extensions.

The structure of the file is compatible with both YAML and XML: it is
a tree, each node is a set of name-value tuple.  The name is a string
(letters, digits, '-' and '_'), the value can be a number, a string, a
node, or a list of nodes.  In the Cheby format, the type of the value
for a tuple is fixed.

It is possible to add extensions to the description, using a node name
that starts with 'x_' (or 'x-').  The extension to support Cheburaska
particularities is 'x_gena'.


Some definitions
----------------

A *bit* is the smallest unit of data and is either 0 or 1.
A *byte* is a group of bits that constitutes the storage unit; the processor
reads and writes data per byte or group of bits.
A *word* is the common group of bytes that could be efficiently handled by
the processor.
An *address* is a number that identifies a particular byte in the memory.

The physical data representation is defined by the following parameters.  Not
all combinaisons need to be supported.
* byte_size: number of bits per byte (always 8).  Addresses unit is the byte.
* bit_endianness: how bits are numbered in a byte/word (always LE)
* word_size: number of bytes per word (default is 4;
             {1, 2, 4, 8} might be supported)
* byte_endianness: the order of bytes in a word (BE by default)
* word_endianness: the order of word in long/very long words (same as
                   byte_endianness is only supported).

Lexical definitions
-------------------

A number is represented either in decimal or in hexadecimal with the
'0x' prefix:
  number ::= [0-9]+ | 0x[0-9a-fA-F]+
An address is either a number or the string next:
  address ::= number | "next"
  "next" means the following aligned address.
A boolean is either the string true or false (the first letter can be in upper
case):
  boolean ::= True | true | False | false
The type of a tuple is one of the above basic type, a list, or a node:
  type ::= number | address | boolean | list | node
A list is represented by choices separated by '|' within curly braces (non
meta-character are within single quotes):
  list ::= '{' type { '|' type } '}'


File format
===========

Root node
---------

The root node starts the description of the memory map.  The name of the root
node is 'memory-map', there is only one root node, and it has these attributes:

bus: string
  Define the physical interface for the memory map as well as the physical
  representation of data.  Must be one of:
  "be-vme-32": CERN-BE specific VME-like interface. 32 bit words, stored in
    big-endian.
  "wb-32-be": Wishbone bus using 32 bit words stored in big-endian.
  "axi4-lite-32": AXI4 lite bus using 32 bit words.
word-endian:
  Define the endianness of register longer than one word.
  The default value is defined by the bus (big-endian for be-vme and wb-32-be,
  little-endian for axi4-lite-32'), but can be overriden by this attribute.
  The value can be: 'little', 'big' or 'none'.  'none' means that no
  register can be longer than a word.
name: string
  Identifier that names the memory map.  Names must be uniq at the same level.
comment: string
  Short string (should fit on one line) that describes the map.  This is
  inserted in generated code as a comment.
description: string
  Longer text that explains the purpose of the map.
note: string
  Additional text note.
children: { reg | block | array }
  Content of a memory map.

Compatibility:
'name' corresponds to wbgen prefix.

TODO:
- constants
- configuration values for FESA.

reg
---

A register either regroup several fields or is defined
directly. Contrary to fields, a register is addressable.

name: string
comment: string
description: string
note: string
  Like for the root node but applied on a register.
width: number
  Number of bits for this register; the default value being word_size.
  Need to support at least 8, 16, 32 or 64.
type: string
  The content of a register is either defined by its fields, or by its type.
  They are exclusive.
  One of: unsigned (default), signed, or float.
  Together with 'width', this specifies how to interpret the bits pattern in
  the absence of fields.
access: string
 Access mode from the SW point of view.  One of:
  * rw: register can be written or read.
  * ro: register can only be read. Values read can be different (eg: a status)
  * cst: register can only be read and is constant (at least between
          two resets).
  * wo: register can only be written.
  Rationale: If we try to express the semantic of a register more
   closely (like rw1c), it becomes difficult to express all the
   possibilities.  So better to stay with this minimal set (except for
   cst).  Semantics can be refined by an hdl attribute.
  Rationale: In wbgen access is defined per field.  However, as only registers
   are addressable from a software point of view only registers have access
   mode.
address: address
  Register addresses must not overlap, except if one register is ro
  and the other is wo.  This is needed to described existing devices
  (like wb i2c master), but this practice is deprecated.  HDL generators
  don't need to support overlap.
children: { field }

Compatibility:
In wbgen, a register is always composed of fields.  But when a register is
a single data this simply adds an extra layer of name.

TODO:
'register type' to be instantiated ?

Notes:
Array of fields have been excluded as useless and difficult to be represented
in C.

field
-----

A field represent the smallest described data. It is a sequence of bits.

name: string
description: string
comment: string
note: string
  Like for the root node but applied on a field.
range: string
  Bits used by the field in the register.  Either a number for a 1 bit field,
  or a range "HI-LO" (HI and LO being numbers) for a multi-bit field.
preset: number
  Default value at reset

Overlapping fields in a register are not allowed.
Sub-word write accesses are not allowed: all fields of a word must be
read or written at the same time.

TODO:
enum: give a name to some or all the values [FIXME: how to share enum between
      fields; create a enum node ? reference enums ? describe enums.
      TODO: to be refined, keep Cheburashka codefields for now]

Compatibility:
Fields correspond to subreg in Cheburashka.

block
-----

A block regroups declarations.

name: string
description: string
comment: string
note: string
  If several blocks have the same name, they are considered as the same logical
  block; and only the first one can have a desription and a comment [TO BE
  REFINED]
address: address
align: boolean
  If set to false, then doesn't enfore any restriction on size and
  alignment. The default value is true.
size: number
  Number of bytes for that block. Must be large enough to contain all
  the children.
children: { reg | block | array }


submap
------

A submap allows to import a memory map from an external file.
A generic submap doesn't have any external file a just specify a range of
address that are decoded and handled externally through a bus.

name: string
description: string
comment: string
note: string
address: address
align: boolean
  If set to false, then doesn't enfore any restriction on size and
  alignment. The default value is true.
filename: string
  Relative cheby filename to be imported.
  If not specified, the submap is a generic submap, and both size and
  interface have to be specified.
interface: string
  For a generic submap, this specifies the bus (same values as in the header).
  Otherwise, it can only be set to 'include' if set.  In that case, the
  submap will be directly included in the map.
size: number
  Number of bytes for that submap. Must be large enough to contain all
  the children.  This is optional.

Compatibility:
There are two features in Cheburashka:
 area: group of registers
       size must be a power of 2 (to simplify the decoding)
       address is aligned to a multiple of its size
       can be empty (just create an interface)
       can be reserved (in that case the slave doesn't respond to any access
         to that area).
 submap: special case of area, but content is described in a separate file
Blocks could be used to implement fifo from wbgen:
 add specific attributes for hdl generation
 no support for 'optional' and 'reset'.


array
-----

(Deprecated, use memory or repeat).

An array is a repetition of a structure.  They are considered to be important
enough to deserve a specific name (and not an attribute of a block).

name: string
description: string
comment: string
note: string
  Like for the root node but applied on an array.
address: address
align: boolean
  If set to false, then doesn't enfore any restriction on size and
  alignment. The default value is true.
repeat: number
  Number of element in the array.  Expected to be a power of 2 for a memory.
size: number
  Number of bytes for the array. Must be large enough to contain all
  the children.
children: { reg | block | array }


Notes:
Memorys are represented as arrays that must be aligned.

Compatibility:
Compared to wbgen, the following features of memories are not supported:
- wrap_bits
- byte_select
- width /= 32


memory
------

Describe a RAM or a ROM.

name: string
description: string
comment: string
note: string
  Like for the root node but applied on an array.
address: address
size: number
  Number of bytes.  Expected to be a power of 2 for a memory.
children: reg


repeat
------

Repeatition of a structure.  They are considered to be important
enough to deserve a specific name (and not an attribute of a block).

name: string
description: string
comment: string
note: string
  Like for the root node but applied on an array.
address: address
repeat: number
  Number of repetitions.
size: number
  Optionnal number of bytes for the repetition. Must be large enough to
  contain all the children.
children: { reg | block | array }
