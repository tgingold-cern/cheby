=== Motivation

In december 2019, it was decided to add versioning for the **schema**
of the core specifications and for the schema of the extensions. The
schema version is defined using semantic versioning. The current
extensions are described in the following sections.

=== x-map-info

This extension is the successor of `x-cern-info` and some attributes
previously used in `x-gena` as well.

It contains 2 possible attributes, see below.

==== ident

Ident is a unique identifier of a memory map which can be feed back to a
ro register to provide information and identification about what type of
board/firwmare the memory map belongs to. The value itself is not
standardized among the different CERN groups.

In RF we have a long standing list of idents (formarlly names
ident-code in the old cheburashka based memory maps) for VME which are
mastered centrally by John Molendijk (`+john.molendijk@cern.ch+`). For
uTCA based boards we start from scratch with a new list of
idents. Currently there is no central person or location to award them
and in fact the firmware does not yet provide any meaningful data. But
a first
https://confluence.cern.ch/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=415713698[confluence
page] has been created.

* *Previous used ident-code attribute in x-cern-info/ident-code and
x-gena/ident-code are migrated to x-map-info/ident*

==== memmap-version

The memorymap version attribut is now a semantic version only consisting
of 3 parts with 8bits each. As an attribute value they have to be
specified as a string separated by dots. The different parts are using
the standard schema MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH as specified by
https://semver.org[Semantic Versioning] These values are being exposed
by according registers in the firmware/IP cores.

* *Previous x-cern-info/semantic-mem-map-version is migrated to
x-map-info/memmap-version*
* *Previous x-gena/semantic-mem-map-version is migrated to
x-map-info/memmap-version*
* *Previous x-gena/map-version which was a date-code is debriacted and
should not longer be used in new maps*

=== x-gena

Attributes of this extension should NOT be used anymore with new
designs. When using the new gen-cheby generation tool, this attributes
are ignored!

=== x-fesa

Attributes provided by this extension should be mainly used and/or
decided on together with the FESA class developer or HW designer with
sufficient experience with FESA.

* generate - default=True
* persistence - default=True
* multiplexed - default=True
* … way more ..

==== generate

This attribute allows to specify a boolean value [True|False]. By
default (even if not present) the values is set to "`True`"

The FESA generator will create a matching field in the data store of the
FESA class for each register if the attribute is not specified or
explicitly declared with "`True`". If you want to avoid this because the
data does not need to be stored anywhere (for example because you are
reading it every time on the fly from the hardware) this attribute can
be used to suppress generation of a field.

A warning should be issued if the value is set to "`False`" but
additional attributes such as for example "`persistence`" or
"`multiplexed`" are specified.

==== persistence

This flag existed already in the past but it’s usage was rather obscure.
The previous functionality has been split into 2 attributes. One of them
is the persistence attribute. It now does only what the name implies: If
specified with "`True`" the according setting field in the data store
will be marked as persistent as well; which means it’s value is
regularly written into the persistency file. Later one is used to
restore the value(s) of the fields when a FESA processes is restarted.
Thus it makes for example little sense to declare a status, fault or
other acquisition field (aka ro register) as "`persistence`" as the
state most likely has changed in the meantime.

==== multiplexed

In the past FESA provided a attribute called multiplexed. As of FESA3
v.7.0.0 this has changed. Now they distinct between multiplexed (setting
fields) and cycle-bound (acquisition fields). For the sake of simplicity
in Reksio we provide only one attribute called "`multiplexed`".
Depending of the type of the register the attribute belongs to, it is
translated correctly to either of the 2 previous choices depending on
the register type (ro, rw)

=== x-driver-edge

TBD: For now this is just the list of existing attributes, further
documentation needs to be added:

* name
* equipment-code
* module-type
* vme-base-addr
* endianness
* bus-type
* board-type
* driver-version
* driver-version-suffix
* schema-version
* description
* device-info
* interrupt-controllers
* generate: set to False to exclude this block/reg from the driver
* fifo
* block-prefix
* expand: set to _True_ to expand block, submap or repeat (with single reg) nodes instead of having a
single line with increased depth
* include: set to _False_ when a direct included submap (_True_) does not have a parent `+block+`

Might be added at some point:

* default-pci-bar-name
* generate-separate-library

==== bus-type

Currently supported: VME, PCI, VME64x, PLATFORM

==== schema-version

The EDGE version to be used; currently supported 3.x and 4.x

==== driver-version

Even there is no clean solution and clear solution yet on the CCDE side,
it is possible to specify a specific version to be used for a specific
hardware type. On the driver (generation) side versioniong is now
supported. It therefore is mandatory to specify a version for your
driver. The GUI makes sure the version follows the constraints of
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. This version is direclty feed into the CSV
file generated by the Reksio GUI and used by edge to generate a driver.

==== driver-version-suffix

With the limitation to MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH for production the feature of
re-releasing a driver is prevented by intention. In order to deal with
this during development, this attribute allows the use of an arbitrary
suffix i.e. “_dev”.

==== device-info

The PCI device info is mandatory for PCI modules as the kernel idenifies
the board with this ID in order to know which driver to load to access
the hardware.

TBD: Format

It is possible to not add all of the attributes if you have a driver
which fits more than one card.

* vendor-id
* device-id
* subvendor-id
* subdevice-id
* revision-id (for VME64x)

==== CHILDREN x-driver-edge

Beside the attributes above x-driver-edge provides to elements
(children) to be specified, for example in an `+address-space+` (see
higher).

* number
* addr-mode
* data-width
* [size]
* [dma-mode]

==== interrupt-controllers

With the following attributes, for each interrupt-controller: * name *
description * type: INTC_SR, INTC_CR * chained * args: enable-mask,
ack-mask * reg-role * type: IRQ_V, IRQ_L, ASSERT * args: min-val,
max-val

=== x-conversions

=== x-wbgen

=== x-devicetree

=== x-interrupts

=== x-enums

Enumerations - reusable replacement of `x-gena/code-fields`.

Enumerations are defined under a memory-map element as its children.
They can be referenced (used) by reg and field nodes, using x-enums/name
attribute.

Each enumeration item contains:

* name
* (optional) width
* (optional) description
* (optional) comment
* children
** item
*** name
*** value

=== Deprecated extensions

==== x-cern-info

This attribute is deprecated! Please use link:#x-map-info[x-map-info]
