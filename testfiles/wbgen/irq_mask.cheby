            Writing 1 disables handling of the interrupt associated with corresponding bit. Writin 0 has no effect.

            Each bit represents the state of corresponding interrupt. 1 means the interrupt is pending. Writing 1 to a bit clears the corresponding interrupt. Writing 0 has no effect.
